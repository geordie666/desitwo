  The corrector lenses range in diameter from 0.85 meters to 1.46 meters, which are smaller
  than the largest Rubin camera lens (1.55 meters). Notably, all of the lenses are spherical
  surfaces, which simplifies their manufacture relative to Rubin and DESI which each
  had several aspherical surfaces. The corrector includes two counter-rotating lenses
  that act as an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC), as was done for DESI. The focal
  plane is a 0.82-meter diameter surface situated under the primary mirror, allowing easy
  accessibility. The optical speed at the focal plane is f/3.6 with only a few percent
  variation, which is perfectly matched to the Spec-S5 spectrographs.
