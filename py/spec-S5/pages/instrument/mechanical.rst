  The existing 4-meter mirrors of the Mayall and Blanco Telescopes would be removed and
  replaced with segmented 6-meter mirrors. Minor modifications will be made to the “U” of
  the horseshoe mount in order to provide space for the new primary. In the proposed design,
  the secondary mirror is supported above the primary with four legs and directs light into the
  corrector, and then the focal plane instrumentation, at Cassegrain. A major advantage
  to this design is that the opto-mechanical structure can be assembled and tested prior to
  integration on the telescope.
