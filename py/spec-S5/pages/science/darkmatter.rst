      <p style="font-size:21px"> The fundamental nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding mysteries in particle physics more than
      90 years after its astrophysical discovery. Cosmic survey experiments can probe the nature of dark matter by measuring the clumping of
      dark matter on cosmic scales. Spec-S5 will build upon DESI observations and provide a sample of 50 million stellar spectra to explore
      the particle properties of dark matter as a secondary science goal. Observations from Spec-S5 will be unique and complementary to dark
      matter studies with other celestial (e.g., Rubin LSST, CMB-S4) and terrestrial (e.g., direct detection, collider, and beam dump) experiments.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px"> The dimensionless linear matter power spectrum extrapolated to a redshift of z = 0. Theoretical predictions are plotted for
      eight models for dark matter that modify power relative to the fiducial CDM predictions. Figure from
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07354"> Bechtol et al. (2022)</a>. The Spec-S5 program is designed to explore the mass distribution of
      galactic-scale halos in the vicinity of approximately 107 to 108 <i>M<sub>&#9737;</sub></i> and the transition between galactic and sub-galactic halos.</p>
